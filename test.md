#Teamwork Contract for Group 24

## Communication

<p> The group has created a slack channel through which to communicate. We have also decided to have an initial Zoom meeting to establish the content of the teamwork contract and divide up the milestone tasks.</p>

## Timing

<p>Our primary mode of communication will be through slack. Timely messages are defined as within 24hrs; if an individual is not going to be available to respond to messages for longer than a 24 hours period, they should let the group know over slack that they will be away.</p>
