,May 16/42,
,Dear Joan;-,
,Hi Joan!! Was I surprised to hear from you so soon!,
,It’s so lonely and quiet here I keep thinking about you all the time and what you’re doing.,Joan; Homesickness
,"Gosh, was I pleased to hear from you. I received your first letter on May 12, [&] then two days later, while I was in the garden, my sister brought home another one! I recognized your writing on the envelope and ripped it open & read it immediately. The way how I threw down my hoe to read it, my mother knew who the letter was from. I read your letters, I don’t know how many times. Next day, I happened to look in the envelope and the first letter was dated (or stamped) May 1, while the second, May 8. I don’t know how it happened, but I suppose it was because we haven’t been to town for ages.",Joan; Mail
,"You’re wondering, no doubt, why you haven’t got word from me, but I’m writing to-night, which is the only night I could find spare time.",Communications
,"How is your father, mother, Donalda and yourself? I hope you are all well. We are all feeling fine and gradually getting used to this Alberta surroundings. It’s not quite as bad as we first came out here to Raymond.",
,"We’ve had a very bad weather all this week. It has been raining, windy, rain and sleet, snowing & freezing. Yesterday and this morning I found a thick ice covering the surface of our water pail. Especially this morning, we were all shivering because we couldn’t start the fire. It certainly has been a very bad week, and we hope next week would be better. I hope you had a nice weather back in British Columbia.",Living-conditions
,"I am sorry to hear that you have not been feeling well, but staying home and getting rested up and relaxed would make you better, I hope. Well anyways, please take care of yourself.",
,"I hope your Social Studies test wasn’t too hard as you said it was. Boy am I lucky I didn’t have to write it!! But a “proffessional [sic] student” like you always say [sic] it’s hard and then the result – the highest mark in “Grade 9.” How are you getting along in French, English, Math, Science, etc?",
,"Gosh, but I wish I was together with you back in school. Do I wish to see the faithful “Queen Elizabeth High School” again, but it won’t be for quite a while.",Education; Homesickness
,"Yesterday and the day before, we have been in the garden planting some seeds. We planted some water mellons [sic], canteloupes [sic], potatoes, carrots, cabbages, beans, …. etc. It’s a pity you can’t come down & eat some of the things we have grown (if they growe well).",Labour-conditions
,"The roads around here are terrible after it rains. No cars nor bycicles [sic] can ride on it. The earth gets soft and sticks onto the tires; therefore just skidding and slipping in one place. We can’t even walk on it ourselves, or else the mud sticks on to our shoes so much it gets too heavy to walk.",Living-conditions
,There isn’t such a road in British Columbia even if you searched fore one. That’s true!,Homesickness
,"Yesterday, while I was riding on a bike going to buy some eggs, I took a bad spill. My slack’s leg got caught on a hook or something that was sticking out and [there], I didn’t know it and was going full speed ahead. Bang!! we both fell, and a piece of my slacks got torn. I got several bruises, but not as bad as what yours was. I tried to get up, but I couldn’t for a minute. Then a car comes along towards heading my way, and somehow I managed to get up and drag the bike to one side of the road. A young man was in the car and he asked if I hurt myself badly. I just said I only got a few bruises which was nothing at all. I haven’t seen him since.",
,"Many cars pass in front of our house, and every one of them honks their horns. I don’t know why, but I guess it’s just a friendly way of passing instead of not honking.",
,"I heard there was a “May Day” this year. Did you go to it? We wanted to go to it, but was impossible. All that day, I was thinking about the school. — only have [sic] of the pupils present.",Education; Homesickness
,"It is a common sight to see the clothes-line only about the height of myself, while the clothes-line back in B.C. was higher than the roofs of our houses. I suppose it’s because the wind is too strong.",
,"There are no trees here in Alberta. Everywhere you look, just level plains of farming lands can be seen, while back in B.C: everywhere you look are trees and nothing but trees. Not one speck of the beautiful mountains can be seen either. We all miss our beautiful B.C. trees and mts.",Living-conditions; Homesickness
,"We left our cat and dog at home and are always wondering if they are still alive. We all think our dog would be dead because he always used to bark at many people and get stones thrown at. This is none of your affairs to look after, but I just wrote it in to fill up space.",Homesickness
,"You must have had a good time riding home with Kirkbride. Afterall, any body would like to ride home with a companion who says funny things rather than a companion who isn’t interesting to talk with very much. He hasn’t got anybody to ride home with him now and you haven’t either, so what’s the matter riding home together? I think that’s swell.",
,"That was a tricky thing Betty did of taking pictures of you & Kirkbride. If you ever get hold that picture, will you please send one? (if you don’t mind.) We haven’t a camera yet, so are unable to take pictures, but if we do, I promise I’ll send it to you.",Photographs
,"The letter is getting long and boring you, no doubt, so I had better close now. Give my best regards to your mother, father, and sister. I think I’ve said everything what I have to say, so good-bye Joan, I am thinking of you all the time.",Joan; Homesickness
,"With love,",
,"Your friend as ever,",

,May 30/42,
,"Dear Joan,",
,"Thank you ever so much for the letter I received today. You could have imagined how surprised I was to hear from you so soon! I am not wasting a minute in writing to you. But, oh! fat, large letters every time! That’s what I like. I don’t know how you do it, but gosh, it’s so interesting, that I read it over I don’t know how many times. There isn’t any interesting things to write around here, so you can write all the news back home.",Communications; Homesickness
,I feel sorry for you and Donalda about being,
,"missing a week of school, especially you, when you missed two final exams! I don’t blame you for not getting mad. I know I will.",
,"Where did Setsuko Fujii go? And where did Sonny & Albert go to? We don’t get any newspaper so we don’t know anything. Whenever Dad goes to town, he buys a “Lethbridge Herald News” paper. It has only the half of the pages from that of Sun or Province, and there is no news of Vancouver or New Westminster. The other day, I sent a letter to “The Vancouver Daily Provinces” asking them if they can send a newspaper over here to Raymond. Do you think they will?",Communications; Forced-dispersal; Homesickness
,"As for the pictures, you don’t have to send them to me, but I am asking for only the spare ones you have. I will be very",Photographs
,grateful to you if you can spare some few to me.,Photographs
,"Yesterday (May 29th) was Sports Day, and my sister & I certainly hope the “White House” would win. The way you write about the “Whites,” it sounds as if we are in an awful position. I hope the White House will improve. Good going for 2 E. [ill.]!! Three times in succession now. I hope they defeat the Langley High School this time. Were the same persons on again? I wish I had listen to it, but it was impossible as we have no radio. Maudsleys’ got a bycicle radio, but we can’t hear Vancouver, tough luck.",Communications; Homesickness
,"We don’t get blackout practice over here. Even if we do, we don’t hardly put our lamp lights on, so it’ll be simple, I think.",Living-conditions
,The time is now 9:05 P.M. and it is still light outside.,Living-conditions
,"The weather here is very peculiar. For few days before, it was so hot that we went barefooted in an irrigation ditch (even though we aren’t supposed to.) and we couldn’t eat our meals heartily. Then the next day (cold) it would be cold. This week, it was so cold! and it rained too much!",Living-conditions; Labour-conditions
,"The peas, beans, cabbages, & corns have started to grow, but the others haven’t. Dad says maybe it may be rotten, because the ground is too wet and form large puddles in low places.",Labour-conditions
,"Today, I have gone out killing gophers. Only one in one hour.",Labour-conditions
,"That’s bad! One afternoon, Teruko and I got twelve in five hours. We’ve altogether killed approximately fifty by now. We were told to kill as many as we can because they do damage to sugar-beets or vegetables.",Labour-conditions
,"We still haven’t started on our sugar-beets yet. It has only two large & two small leaves, while it has to have at least six leaves. I don’t think I’m going to like the job of thinning. Some people have started working on them already, but was held in because of the bad weather.",Beet-farms
,"When we go back to school in September, we will have to repeat the same grade. Even",Education
,"if I go back to QEHS, I won’t be in the same grade as you and the pupils in the present Grade 9. I don’t know if I will be able to go back to school. It all depends on how our sugar-beets turn out. I really want to go back to school though.",Education; Labour-conditions
,"We are still living in our one-room house, if you can call it a house! Only mice can have the pleasure of living in here. Every night, they come in and eat everything they can find. Last night, it chewed my Dad & Mom’s socks, and made beautiful decorative holes in it. Still worse, it made a large hole (about 2 inches in diameter) on the back of my best summer coat. Was I",Living-conditions
,"mad! I lost my temper then. Mom isn’t going to mend it because she said it’ll look funny. Instead, she’s going to take it to the tailor’s to get it mended, but the trouble is, there is no tailor in Raymond, so it is still how it is. My Dad can’t fix or improve the house because there is no material yet. We all hope it will arrive soon.",Living-conditions
,"Listen, Joan, your letter isn’t a scrawl, no more than my scribbling. (and how) I rather want to read your handwritten letter than anything else I can think of. It doesn’t seem right if its [sic] typed or pressed. And I certainly like reading long letters",Communications
,", and if you don’t mind, you can write everything what has happened.",Homesickness; Communications
,"Thank you very very much for sending those pink roses. There is no bush of them growing here, and it certainly looks dull, without them. It reminded all of us back home in B.C. “You are very thoughtful,” mum says, “to send them to us.” Same here.",Homesickness
,"Do “purple violets” & “forget-me-nots” have seeds? If they have seeds, will you please send a teeny weeny bit? Mrs. Maudsley wants some of those seeds & she can’t get them here in Raymond.",Farm-owners

,your mother mind giving away just a few?,
,Was I surprised when you wrote to me that Mr. Sanford is going to join the Air Force. I didn’t even dream of him joining it!,WWII
,"The letter is getting too long now and I had better close it. Your eyes must be sore trying to read and make out my scribbling. I am sorry to write such a long letter, but I hope you don’t mind. We all wish to be back home as soon as possible, & I’ll remember you always. Well, I guess I had better stop for final, as I am getting to the end of the page so good-bye & good health till",Communications; Joan; Homesickness

,July 31/42,
,"Dearest Joan,-",
,"Hello Joan! I’m sorry but honestly I meant to answer your lovely letter the night I received it, but somehow or rather its [sic] almost over a month now. (my head is hung in shame. ahem!!) I just love long, long letters and yours just hit the spot – swell! but I can’t write long letters for anything. Also, your letter’s the most interesting and I drop whatever I’m doing and read it immediately.",Communications
,"I bet you were proud when you received your first pay from berry-picking. I certainly wish I was in your boots! Were you able to find another job? I hope so, but not a strenuous one.",
,"Did we have some heat last week and now do you know that it just poured like cats & dogs and it even hailed. We started running home but by the time we were half through the field, it even poured harder and we reached home just drenched. There was no fire and did we ever feel comfortable! Gosh, it’s a crazy weather out here. It certainly know [sic] how to change suddenly. Almost every night, there is a thunderstorm following with",Living-conditions
,"heavy rain, and is it ever pleasant working in a wet field, let me tell you.",Labour-conditions
,"The only reason why I didn’t write to you earlier was that I couldn’t find time, Joan. (touch of laziness may be included too.) Every time when I start to write I can’t seem to get it finished. You know, I tried at least six times and every time, I had to start newly again; but this time I’m going to finish it for sure. Mind you, I couldn’t get it off my mind.",Communications
,"And oh, Joan! Am I ever glad!! We finished our first hoeing yesterday but after this we’ve got to hoe Maudsley’s corn. (I thought we get a rest; but oh, no!) Hoeing isn’t so bad as how thinning was. Usually, every year by this time people say that they should be on their second hoeing by now, and fighting for water. We needn’t fight for water this year, no sireeee! You see, Dad had to haul hay in for about a week and a half so we had to do the best without him. We didn’t want to get behind the others so we worked longer hours than most people. And now, Dad is building another room approximately the",Labour-conditions
,"same size in which we are living in now. (12’x14’) Then, it’ll be a decent house to live in; don’t you think?",Living-conditions
,"Many of our beets got drowned on account of too much rain, poor things. The ones which were planted on a higher land is [sic] coming just dandy, but I’m afraid the ones planted on a lower land isn’t [sic] coming along so good as we thought. Certainly, I’m going to bring home some “Raymond Sugar” to you. I don’t know if they’re the finest and sweetest sugar in the world, but at least, they taste like sugar. Every sugar we buy in bags or sacks, it has “Raymond, Alberta” written on it. Imagine, a small country-like town of Raymond written on sugar bags! Someday, it’s going to make a history of the largest sugar producing factory in Canada. Day after day, you do the same work and it seems like ages until you get accustomed to the long monotony of working in the beet-fields.",Beet-farms; Labour-conditions
,"I haven’t been to town for ages, so I just can’t tell you what fruits they sell. I Know they sell oranges because we buy it ever so often. Sometimes my brother goes to town and he says that they sell oranges, apples, cherries, raspberries, and strawberries. He also said that the berries look half rotten, or I mean stale, and not so large and juicy and red as back in B.C. We’re all going to miss our fruits & berries this year.",Living-conditions; Homesickness
,Our garden is coming along good and,Labour-conditions; Living-conditions
,"bad – I don’t know which. Cabbages, carrots, corns, lettuces, and potatoes are coming along swell. Mellons [sic], cucumbers, squash & canteloupes [sic] didn’t come up at all. I think they probably got drowned. And do you know what? The tomato plants have started bearing fruits now. I hope the rain won’t ruin them after they’re nice and ripe. Honestly, the rain & wind just ruined our peas & beans. They weren’t good at all this year. Altogether we have five hundred fifty plants of cabbages & is it growing dandy. I think I’ll go on a “Cabbage Diet” this year winter – but don’t say anything about diet just now, because I’m eating like a hog. How’s my waistline did you ask? Well – ahem, I think I look more like a sack of potato than I looked before. I don’t know how much I weigh ‘cause I haven’t weighed myself since – heaven knows when!!",Labour-conditions; Living-conditions
,"Has the carpenter finished fixing your house yet? If he did, surely your house must be pretty now; even though it was from the beginning. Have you, by any chance, strolled down about our vicinity? If you have, that is if, will you please tell us what condition it is in? Even though we barred all our windows & doors, we don’t feel safe ‘cause many of our things are still left in the house. (especially the attic.)",Homesickness; Forced-dispersal

,"It’s so peaceful & quiet and nothing happens here, so I haven’t anything much to write to you. Ah, yes! There was a Stampede on the 1st & 2nd of July. On the morning of the 1st there was a parade with fire-crackers going off. Imagine, fire-crackers on Dominion Day!! It seems funny to us, but I guess its [sic] their custom. We went on the 2nd, because it was said that too many people always attend on the 1st that you couldn’t hardly see the performances. Lucky for us that we did! and it was a wonder that both days were fine. There were many different performances such as bucking, steer decorating, calf roping, horses, etc.. . A cowboy was sent to the Lethbridge hospital because he got kicked or stepped on or something by the horse. (P.S. there is no hospital in Raymond.)",Recreation
,"It was fun, but I would have enjoyed it more if you were with me, Joan. And I certainly wish you did see it too. Mother was the only one that didn’t go because she didn’t want to see them get bucked off. Raymond is noted for having its first stampede in the whole Dominion of Canada, thirty-nine years ago this July 1st, 1942.",Recreation; Joan; Homesickness
,"I have lot [sic] more to write about the Stampede, but I guess I had better stop or they’ll charge me double.",Communications; Communications
,"I don’t know how much to thank you for those plants & seeds, Joan. You know, I only asked for the seeds, and here, you sent the plants so you could just imagine how surprised I was. Mom told me to thank you very very thank much. It’s just coming along swell.",Homesickness
,"And – thank you very very much for those lovely pictures you have sent. Were [sic] still allowed to have a camera yet, but since we haven’t one, we’ll have to borrow someones. We’re intending to take pictures before our cameras get banned, if they ever do. I promise that I am going to send you some, but I don’t know when, only that its in the near future.",Photographs; Communications
,"Well, I must say that this letter certainly got long, but I hope you don’t mind, do you Joan? Even though we’re far apart, I know we’ll meet again – and I hope it’ll be soon. I’ll always remember you and think of you, no matter when & where. I’m just itching for the time to come, when we’re all together and happy once more.

,"Honestly, I’m so ashamed of myself I just can’t find the right words to tell you how sorry I am for being so long at writing you. But I hope you understand, I and forgive me, please???? To start out with “Hello to you all” and I hope you all had a nice “Xmas” & “A Happy New Year”. (Though I never wrote a letter wishing you so, but I took granted [sic] that you meant it from me anyways.) However, here’s hoping that this letter finds the Gillis’ family in best of health.",Communications
,"Thanks ever so much Joan for your lovely present which you sent; it’s just perfect & the thing I needed most. Honestly, I never dreamed of receiving such present as this under the present condition; I never expected to receive anything from you this year so you can just imagine how pleased I was!!! You know, we can’t seem to break the “tie” between us & I hope that we never do. (not on earth, I won’t.)",Joan
,"Well, here’s me going back to school for another year. – Really??? but I doubt if I’ll go back again next year (I mean if I am still in Raymond then.) Boyohboy!! I’d give anything to be back at good ol’ Queen Elizabeth. I’m suffering enough as I am now & I don’t think I could stand for another year! After two whole month’s work to catch up, it was impossible for me to",Education; Homesickness
,"write to you. (I started school on Nov. 2nd, same day as Teruko Ikeda.) I think I really could have written to you if I had tried harder. I don’t know how it happened, but I’m sitting in the Grade X room anyways. French I, Soc. St., English, Health, General maths, Biology I, Home Economics are the subjects I’m taking this year, making a total amount of 30 credits for Grade X. If I go through school in Raymond, I’ll have to come 2 years of Gr. 12 to get all my credits. Credits start from Gr. 10 over here, and by the time you get out of high, you’ll have to have a hundred credits. Only Typing I is given & Bookkeeping I and no shorthand writing. Home Economics & health ends in Gr. 10. Grades 11 and 12 will not have to take health unless they wish to get some credits and take it with some lower grades. It certainly is a crazy way, don’t you think, Joan? I get 11 study periods a week and that’s monotenous [sic] so I wanted to take more credits, but the principle (Mr. Jacobs.) said 30 credits is enough for a late-commer [sic] so I’m still carrying 30 credits. You can’t take more than 35 credits a year. Every Thursday, last period we get a 20min seminary. Mostly everybody out here are Mormans [sic]. I never heard of this religion back in B.C. The",
,"religions are divided into 3 groups; the Mormans, United, and Budhists [sic]. I go to the United, & Mrs. Rolfson’s our lecturer. Did you read an article in the school-paper about Miss Gottenburg being married to Mr. Rolfson? Well, this is our teacher while Mr. Rolfson is a Morman and he teaches the Morman pupils.",
,"There are no lockers in this school, and you just hang the coats up as we used to do in S.W. Public School, except that the coat hangers are way higher. The class-room doors doesn’t [sic] open until a teacher comes along & opens it for us. Do you know why the doors are kept locked? Out here, it seems as if the kids can’t be trusted, & I think this is true! I had a brand new ruler an [sic] pencil and after one week it disappeared right off my desk! Was I mad. After that, I brought another new pencil & this one disappeared also. Now I don’t carry a ruler or a pencil except for my new fountain-pen which I keep it in my jacket pocket and take it around with me wherever I go. On the whole, work is fairly easy and not as much homework as we used to get back in B.C.",Education
,"Tests out here seems [sic] just like those oral questions we used to have nearly every day. In June, they have the final examination. $1.50 or $1.70 per test. If I take every one of these examinations, believe me I’ll be broke! They also take a Government examination in Grade 9. Kids say that Government exams are easier than teacher’s exams, but I wouldn’t know",Education
,unless I took one myself.,Education
,"Oh, goodness gracious!! but are the boys noisy! They (the boys) run in the hall-ways, run up or down the stairs, shout, fight, etc. in the school building and whenever the teacher comes, the teacher passes on without saying anything about behaving! If you’re caught throwing chalks, the penalty is one new box of chalks for the school. The kids are allowed to wear slacks, ‘kerchiefs, skii-pants [sic] or skiis suit [sic], coats, etc. during classes. When they answer the teachers, their reply may be no, yes, sure, etc. And not. — “no, sir”, “yes, sir,” and in cases of a lady teacher, “yes, so & so” or “no, so & so.”",Education
,"The kids thought it was funny when Teruko Ikeda or I said “yes, sir” or “no, sir” to a teacher. This shows how much they are mistacken [sic], & not us. Pupils aren’t so co-operative as the ones back in B.C. schools and they think that their school is of a high standard, but not to me. Our building has only two floors, while the Public building has four floors. You see, Joan, High School & Public School are separate buildings. On the whole, public building is larger. Both buildings are made of brick.",Education; Homesickness
,For 3 months school starts at 9:30 A.M. because it is so dark in the morning around 9:00 A.M. Lunch is from 12:15 P.M to 1:30 P.M. School begins again in the afternoon at 1:30 P.M. until 4:00 P.M. but there is a ten minute afternoon recess.,Education
,"For a month, since we started, we walked to school until December 1, the van from the cheese factory began to run. In the mornings, the van isn’t so crowded as in night because the driver makes 2 trips; but at nights, he takes us all in one trip so you can just imagine how crowded it is inside! The Raymond Highway kids gets [sic] on the first trip (this is us.) and the Stirling Highway gets on the second trip. We reach school around 8:30 A.M. so we asked the principle for permission to play basketball in the mornings. The principle said “yes” so we play in the gym, which is only about 1/3 of 2.E.’s gymnasium. For P.T., girls may wear skirts, dresses, shorts, slacks, or even leather sole shoes because I do. In Lethbridge or Raymond, I went all over the shoe stores asking for girls’ white running shoes, but they don’t have anymore in stock. After P.T. everyone’s supposed to take a shower, but no one ever does, besides there isn’t any time. Well, Joan, I think I’ve talked enough about school, so I think I’d better leave the rest for the next letter.",Education; Recreation
,"The weather certainly changes quick out here. Just last week it was so cold, but now, the temp. is up to 40 degrees. The coldest has been around 20 degrees below. Out here, even if it is 30 degrees or 20 degrees below, you can’t feel it, but just to make people say “Gee, it’s cold today.” Once we walked 5 miles to school in 17 degrees below zero. It was kinda colder than most mornings we",Living-conditions
,"thought, but I didn’t imagine it would be 17 degrees below. The van didn’t run at this time yet.

,"Almost every farmer has started threshing again since the weather is excellent. My Dad has gone threshing also, except that our owner’s thresher machine is old & gets broken easily; then my Dad has to stay around the machine & fix it everytime. He’s more of a mechanist than a wheat hauler, but he doesn’t mind as he likes the job as a mechanist better. You know, he’s so small & short, he’s able to go under the machine & fix it.",Labour-conditions
,"Our beet crop on the whole was satisfactory. It averaged around 11 ½ tons per acre, while most of the other crops yielded 9-9 ½ tons per acre. We harvested ours quite early so we did 5 acres of anothers man’s crop. If we had just finished harvesting our own crop and then went to school, I won’t be so far behind in my school-work. However, I’m getting caught up on it soon.",Beet-farms; Education
,"Joan, do you know what I got for my birthday? Guess, — first. I got a pair of black skates!! Just what I had been wishing for the last three years, and now I got my chance to get them.",Recreation
,"When I return home again, you & I would go skating to the arena or wherever there is a skating pond. (if you want me as a company.) I think that would be fun. There is a rink in Raymond town which anybody can go in free & stay, as long as they want to skate. I believe it’s open every afternoon until 10:00 P.M. and 12:00 midnight, only on Saturday nights. There is also some music playing from the girl’s changing room. There is also another rink for boy’s hockey square next to the larger skating rink. I practiced skating on Teruko’s skates on the frozen pig lake. Here’s where we go mostly afterschools [sic] because it takes just about 8 minutes’ walk, any anyways [sic] it’s Maudsleys’, so he won’t chase us out.",Recreation; Joan; Optimism
,"Well, I’ve written enough for now so I guess I had better close. It’s such a long boring letter that it’ll take at least 2 days to read it, and what a scribble!
