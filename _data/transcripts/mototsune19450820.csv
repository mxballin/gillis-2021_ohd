,Dearest Joan:,
,I don’t know whether I should congratulate you first or tell you I’m sorry for not writing sooner. ,Communications
,"At any rate, Congratulations, Joan, and I hope you all the success in the world. I’m awfully glad you graduated and for being the most proficient girl student. You well deserved the title.",Joan
,"Thank you for the Q. E. VUE and the pretty photo. You look so charming and mature. Everybody says you are so pretty. If ever I take a picture of myself, I promise to send you one. I could not find a suitable card so I just bought one which was the most suitable. What I sent to you about a month ago is just a small appreciation for your kindness and to show how glad I am you graduated.",Communications; Photographs

,"I bet you didn’t worry half as much as I did. My gov’t exam results came a week ago last Monday. Honestly I was scared stiff even to open the envelope. I won’t tell you my marks in number, but I got an A in every subject. You should have seen how surprised I was because I had expected D’s & failures. My teachers’ exams results – Psychology, Alg. I, Law – have not arrived yet but am [sic] expecting them soon. At least I know I passed Soc. St., Eng., Chem., and French, thank heavens! Now I have only 7 more credits to complete my 100 cr. and I’ll get my sen. matric next year. (ie. I hope!!!) Since I missed a month’s review (from June 4th – 28th) I thought for sure I was going to fail, but luck certainly was with me. I wrote my",Education
3," exams from June 28th – July 5th. It’s a choice between writing or failing flat, so I thought I’d write, and I certainly am glad I did. Teruko Ikeda wrote only her Eng. Exam and didn’t write the rest. She found the exams too tough. You should have been with me the night before the exams. With such a clever girl as you, I might have got something in my dull mind. I used to come home about 6:00 P.M. and study steadily until midnight – sometimes even until one. I didn’t like to go home while the rest were out in the field working, but I could not help it. Trying to study a year’s work in six or seven hours is quite difficult for me. (of course, it would not be so with you.) When the next morning came, my mind was a complete blank. I’m still surprised how I even passed my exams.",Education

,"You’ll make a very good teacher (even if I say so) and I am sure you will succeed as one. If I had as much brain as you, I will definitely go in for teaching.",
,"Congratulations to Donalda, too. With such pep, energy, cleverness and a leading ability she will make a school term successful and lots of fun. She is a lucky girl.",

,I am glad the war is over for good. What did you do to celebrate? In Raymond there was a bonfire and a free dance. I can hardly believe war is over.,WWII
,Have you seen “National Velvet”? I saw it last [ill.] night. It’s good. Marion (she is the baby of our family) went to see it twice. She is so crazy about horses – all day long she does nothing but draw horses and Margaret O’Brien. She wants a colt for herself but we’ll have to think of our credit first.,Recreation
,Right now I am doing nothing. Just loafing or else canning. On Sept. 15th I promised a lady I will come and help her clean the house they are going to move in. It is a big Gambling house – 3 floored and lots of rooms. It was formerly owned by,Living-conditions; Labour-conditions

,"Government exams are tough, don’t you think so? Every exam is 3 hours long. Of course, those who made up the exams do not expect you to finish the paper. Some papers, such as French contain as much as 22 pages. Chemistry had only 19 pages. It had the least.",Education

,"The weather over here is not so hot as it used to be, which proves that autumn is near and that means beet topping. I even hate to think about it.
