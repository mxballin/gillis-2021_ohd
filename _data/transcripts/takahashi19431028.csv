,"Dear Joan,",
,Hello! Joan. This is your old school pal Jack writing a few lines again. Sure is a long time since we heard from each other.,
,"How’s school? No doubt your [sic] getting along fine there. Sure wish I was still going to Q.E. In Alberta school started on the 10th of October and I just started on the 21, that’s yesterday. It feels sort of funny to be in grade 10 with all the younger pupils. The courses have been changed so the schooling is much better. In grade 10 there is 5 compulsory courses [sic]; English, Mathematics, Health, Social Studies, and Science. Besides that I take French and Industrial arts and typing. There isn’t much activity at school yet but I believe they are going to start some clubs soon. Next Friday we elect a president of the school.",Education
2,All summer I was away from home working on a farm as [sic] hog feeder and trader man ]. Beet topping kept us busy the last 3 weeks but now we’re finished so we can take it easy now.,Labour-conditions
,The weather has been fair for a long while but it doesn’t look so good to-night. We have had frost in the morning just about every day since the middle of September. We had enough snow on September 18th to make everything white believe it or not. That’s the first time I saw snow in Sept. Soon we’ll be seeing plenty of snow and cold weather. I sure don’t like the winters here. Br-r-r it makes me shiver to just think of it. I guess you won’t be seeing old man winter for a while yet.,Living-conditions
,That’s about all so I wish my best regards and Good-bye till I write again,
,Yours truly,
,Jackie,
