The next morning April 21 Harding [???] and I were up from 3 am walking up and down the train and watching the scenery throw [sic] the pass. There it was so cold that the Kicking Horse River had ice around the banks and streams were frozen. In daylight we reached Frields where we put our time ahead one hour. Later we reached Banff.

,Dear Joan;,,
,I received your letter on the fifth day of May but I didn't get it until the next day for I was out working somewhere else for a couple of days. We have been here 18 days. On the 8 and 9th my brother and I started planting the garden. Boy! What a place to make a garden. Clumps of hard dried dirt all over and the ground hard as stone. We had to plant the garden for there isn't no body else to do it.,Labour-conditions,
,"Last night it rained and thundered and lightning flashed so bright that things could be seen plainly. This morning it was still raining. Boy! You should come down here and walk around. Mud about 2 inches. Go out side and you get mud all over your shoe. All we can do is sit in our little wee shack which is only about 10’ by 20’. No radio no nothing in fact no room to move. Yesterday it was so darn windy that your had, paper, cans, pails, and every thing was blown around. The wind made a terrible noise around the corner of the house. Gosh! I'm getting sick and tired of this country. Gee wiz the wind is starting to blow again. Anyways maybe it will dry the ground so a person could walk around with out getting a new sole on your shoe. Friday night about 11 o’clock the irrigation water came down the ditch which is along the side of the road right near our house. The water comes from a mountain in the United States. I haven’t told you about the surrounding yet. Well towards the north the land is quite level without large trees like B.C. Towards the east and south there is a high hill which is about 600ft higher then [sic] where we are. On the",Living-conditions,
,"side of the hill strips of green and brown can be see. From near our home if we look westwards we can see part of the Rocky. From Yoshio’s place which is SW of our place and much higher we can see part of the sugar factory at Raymond which is about 18 miles away. From there we can see about 4 train stations. We can tell if there is a station for we can see grain elevators.About a mile east of our place there is a low steep banked river or a creek running. This is a nice place, clean water down below and small trees and green crass.",Living-conditions,
,One thing I miss is the big trees. Out here you bay 50 cents for a spruce tree about 2 ft tall.,Homesickness; Living-conditions,
,There isn't nothing to do at all around here but go see your friends or catch goffers [sic] or try to. Riding a bike isn't much fun when the wind is blowing against you. I don't mind the rain but darn the wind and rain.,Living-conditions; recreation,
,But soon I guess I will be saying gosh it’s hot I wish the wind will blow. The darn wind blows dust around the place and into your eyes. When the sun shines it gets too darn hot and dry.,,
,In another two weeks time we will be working on our good old sugar beets for some are out all ready [sic]. Boy! Oh Boy! You can think of us bent over sweating and thinning the beats. Gosh!,Beet-farms,

,Thinning isn’t so hard as I thought. All we have to do is to cut out the beets with a how so to leave a beet a hoe length apart. You are supposed to leave only one beet and not two at once place for it won't grow as big. The sugar beet plant is all the same as a ordinary red beet but the leaves aren't red but are green. It look more like a spinach plant than a beet. The only thing wrong is that the weeds cover the garden for it rained so darn much.,Beet-farms; Labour-conditions,

That mean [sic] no work for a couple of days, more grass, more mud, can't go outside without getting muddy. When it rains it’s as same as being stranded on an island for you can't go outside. We hauled some travel along our house so it won't be as muddy as before that’s one thing. I’d for rather [sic] work or be outside than stay inside out from the rain.

,I thought I’d better write this letter before I forget again. I'm just fooling around now.,,
,"We finished thinning on Tuesday, July 1 around 4 P.M. We went up to Yosh’s place to help them thin their beets for a couple of days. On Monday 13th I've started hoeing, that is, taking out the grass around the [???} beets that were left. On Wed. I think it rained so we couldn’t work for a couple of days. We just about finished Wed. that is day before yesterday but when we were all on our last row a big black cloud came over our head. It started thunder and lightning and started to drip. We started on our way home as fast as we could. (We had about 1/2 mile to go). Just as we started it started to pour. It kept up getting worse and worse. Soon it began to hail too. We were all in our shirts soaking wet before we even reached half way home. The wind was blowing from the west and oh boy I really felt the hail as it bounced off my bare arms. I couldn't see about 500 ft in front or around me. When we got home we all were dripping wet. The rain even went through my boots. That sure was a rain and it taught me to run when ever I see big black clouds coming. We just finished having another storm a half an hour ago worse than the other but it was shorter. I thought the cloud would miss us but the wind changed and the cloud came towards us. I’d say it was the blackest clouds I'd ever seen yet. It was as black as coal. When I saw the clouds",Beet-farms; Labour-conditions; Living-conditions,
,our way I wasn't dumb enough to stay out this time but I just got in the house in time. The rain was more like snow for its blown all over by the wind. It’s the first time I'd ever seen rain like that. A couple of miles out from our place they had hail bigger than marbles the other day. Lucky we didn’t. These storms come all of a sudden that you aren't even prepared for rain. Today till about 1 it really was hot.,Living-conditions,
,"They celebrated the birthday of Magrath (I don't what birthday [sic]) to-day at the town park. It isn't what I'd call a park it’s just a play ground with a grand stand. I didn't go although I was playing. They all [sic] kinds of sports and broncho [sic] riding, milking wild steers, that is, they let out a herd of steers out and cowboys lasso them and others on foot carry a milk bottle and try to get some milk the first to get milk gets the prize. They had a parade too. I don't know how that was but I guess it couldn’t be so bad.",Recreation,
,"I went to the Raymond Stampede on July 1st. There wasn't much to see but they charged me 50 cents. All they had was milking the wild steer, lassoing and typing up calf (the first one to tie a calf wins) decorating a steer by leaping off a horse onto a steer and put a ribbon on its horn. They had wild broncho [sic] riding, steer riding, 3 cowboys saddling a wild broncho [sic] and riding to the opposite end of the ground. They also had horse races. It sure was hot that day and I had to sit in the sun. A seat in the Grand Stand was 2 bits and I was full anyway. I rode both ways on my bike and did I sweat. That was about 30 miles all together.",Recreation,

,"P.S. I didn’t seal the envelope last night so I thought I’d tell you how Magrath town took the storm last night. My brothers went to town and told me about it. In town they really had a storm for big hail poured down. The windows on the north end of most of the building and house were all broken to bits, the grain around town that is east and north of town were all knocked down, beets that got hit were all knocked over and they say it",Living-conditions,
,Looks as if they (the leaves) were all chopped up. We were lucky only a little of our beets were hit although not so badly damaged. To-day we can still see hail piled up a little out of town from here. The wind even blew over big trees and took a roof of [sic] a house or barn near town. We were one of the lucky ones but maybe we may get one next time. I hope not anyway. Well so-long!,Living-conditions; Beet-farms,

,How’s the weather out there. Near the end of October and the beginning of Nov it started to get cold and began freezing. We had about 3 snow falls in the beginning of Nov. We had about 4 to five inches of ice (enough to skate on anyways). All of a sudden the weather changed. It began to get warm again for a week or so. Now it changed again this Sunday night. We had snow Sunday night and yesterday which amounted to about 12 to 14” of snow in different places. Today it seems to be clearing up again but no body knows what will happen,Living-conditions,
,I’ve been out working for a couple of weeks now after we had finished our beets for my school days our [sic] over for this term or for ever.

,I must have been still going to school when I wrote the last time. Last March I stopped school again before I finished grade 10 and went to work on a farm and worked there most of the summer and fall. The summer past [sic] without much change. Fall came and passed by November the tenth I left with my brother to camp. I’ve been up here in the wilderness since then and intend to stay till the end of March.,Labour-conditions; education,
,Life isn’t very exciting up here. Work day after day and no where to spend our money or have a little fun once in a while. Rocky Mt.

Two weeks ago was the first time I saw the town since I came here and most of the boys here haven’t had the chance. I had to see the dentist so i got off a couple of days.

,The work here isn’t bad at all for I really like the trees and woods for I’ve always lived in it. The trees only average 20 inches and a few 3 ft so they can’t be compared with B.C. logs.,Labour-conditions,

Then the logs are hauled out by horses to skidways and loaded on sleighs (that’s my job - been at it about 2 months) and sent to the mill and cut. The loading is done all by hand so when large logs come out we have quite a time loading them. Soon they intend to drag out long logs with catipillars [sic] and cut them up at once place then send them to the mill. This way they wouldn’t use as much [sic] horses as the way we are doing it.",Labour-conditions,

I guess I grew a little too -- I’m 5ft 6 now and have been for the last 4 years -- My brothers that is the twins are getting bigger than me. Soon I’ll be the smallest. My older brother is about 5 ft 9. --,Forced-dispersal,
