,Dear Joan:,
,Please forgive me for not writing any sooner. To tell you the truth this is the first chance I got to write after I got home from threshing. I’ll promise you I’ll write sooner the next time. Gee why but come to think of it its almost two month ago I wrote to you isn’t it.,Communications

,We’ve had some nice cold weather out here for a while. The first sight of Jack Frost was seen on the 23rd of Aug. After that we had some cold days for about two wks. Once I went for the milk to our neighbors in the evening nearing 7:30 and the thermometer reading 30 degrees. Boy! But was I surprised to see this Gee whiz and the first snow flury [sic] came,Living-conditions

I was sure surprised how the cold weather comes around here, but now the hot weather seem to have came back again. I guess this is what they call Indian summer. How’s the weather back there I suppose you haven’t met up with Jack frost yet have you?",Living-conditions
,We have just started on our beet harvest about a week ago. Boy I found this job really miserable specially when your shaking the dirt off. The only thing the owner does at harvest is come along with a tractor and loosen the beet out of the heavy gumbo soil. Then we go up 2 rows a piece throwing 8 rows of beets into one row shaking the dirt off at the same time. Then we go back up the row topping it this time soon as we make a pile of beets we throw the leaves over it in,Labour-conditions
3,case it freezes before them come to collect. To topp [sic] this sugar beet we use a heavy knife with a curved hoot at the end to pick it up. This we could only do about 1/2 acre a day or less. To every ton of beets topped we get $1.25 to 8 tons of beet topped and to anything over 8 tons an acre we get 1.00 per ton.,Labour-conditions
,I suppose you’ve heard or read about the mon eclipse on the 25th of Aug. Boy! That was really clearly seen. The sky was clear and besides the moon was in full then.,Living-conditions
