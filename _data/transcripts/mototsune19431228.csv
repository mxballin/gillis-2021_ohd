,"My dearest Joan,",
,"I am just writing few lines to tell you how glad I was to receive your package. Thanks a million, Joan. Honestly, I never dreamed of receiving such a lovely gift. Thanks ever so much, again, Joan. The package arrived in good condition after all the careful work you put into it.",Communications
,"After I received your gift, I’m really ashamed of how I sent mine and the content inside it. I m [sic] very sorry, but I was rushing and just got what was at hand, and I didn’t get pretty wrapping paper, nor stickers nor anything. I’m really ashamed of myself and next year I’ll know better what & how to send presents.",Writing; Joan
,"Did you have a good Christmas Day? Did you have a White Xmas? We didn’t, but I hope you did. Honestly, Christmas day [sic] seemed just as if it were an ordinary day and an autumn weather [sic] – no snow. ",Living-conditions

,"I came home on the morning of the 25th. On Christmas Eve, those folks (The Roddicks) went out from 8:30 P.M. and came back around 11:30 P.M. with a bunch of friends & they didn’t go home till 3:00 in the morning. I had to stay home and put the baby to bed. She slept well until the bunch came and she was up till they went home. Poor kid, I don’t blame her for staying up so late with the radio going on full blast, piano playing, singing carols and talking so loud. On Christmas morning, I slept in till 8:30 A.M. and they slept in till 9:30 A.M. We had breakfast and I finished dishes around 11:00 A.M. Mr. Roddick helped dry the dishes. This was",Labour-conditions

,"I reached home around 12:30 and we had our Christmas dinner around 6:00 P.M. This year we got two turkeys for Christmas present so we had one for Xmas and the other is to be fore [sic] New Year’s. Honestly, I had the most worst stomach ache I had for ages. I think I ate too much turkey and cranberries. Christmas is dull out here. I wish we had the same Christmas as we did back there. Out here, we don’t have a Christmas tree, nor Church Services nor a picture show. We could have a Christmas tree, but we didn’t bring our tree ornaments with us. Xmas isn’t fun out here, and on radio",Homesickness; Living-conditions; Belonging

,"The other day, my father won a quilt from a ticket which he bought for 25ȼ. Oh, it’s pretty and nicely finished. (I don’t mean to brag or boast about it). It’s a wine taffeta comforter with a pretty design on it. The drawing took place in the 2nd Ward Morman [sic] Church. I was certainly surprised when his name was drawn, only he wasn’t there, so Kay went and received it.",
,"Well, I really think I must close now. Thanks again, Joan, for the lovely present and I hope you had a very merry Christmas and hope to have a “Happy and Prosperous New Year.”",
