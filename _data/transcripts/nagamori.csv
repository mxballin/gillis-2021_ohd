Then we go back up the row topping it this time soon as we make a pile of beets we throw the leaves over it in,Beet-farms

The reason why I didn’t answer you letter sooner was because I was way up north of Winnipeg working in a lime quarry, and the fellas at home forgot to send the letter up to me till two month later.
