,"Rainier, Atla.",
,"Dear Joan,",
,"Hel-lo! How’s the thrill of Scott Hill? Thanks for your very nice letter. I certainly enjoyed hearin’ from you. Jesus, Joan, don’t let writing long letters bother your sweet conscience, ‘cause I love ‘em. I love to (as you say) “wade through ‘em,” too.",Joan
,"Well, Joan, what are you doin’ this bright and cheerful morning? Oh! Good morning, Joan. Sleep well? (I hope you read this in the morning)",
,"Well, anyway, how are you Joan? None the worse after that “horrible” weekend, I hope. It sounded like lots of fun to me. And say, I don’t mind being your “it”.",Joan
,"Now for more about your letter: About the work over here; holy ??? but I must of put it on thick. Of course I have time to eat! I’m usually first at the table and last to leave. Boy, but do I love the dinner call! Not because I’m hungry but because we can rest - ah!",Labour-conditions;Living-conditions; Optimism
2,"Beautiful rest! Seriously, though, Joan, I’m not working that hard. The work has been hard but I’m getting use [sic] to it now. We’ve finished all the field work and there’s really not much work to do now. But there’s enough to keep us busy -- darn it. But don’t worry, Joan, I’m not working myself to death. Here pinch my arm. See, I’m alive. Ouch. (You pinched me too hard). Silly, ain’t I?",Labour-conditions; Optimism
,"What do we do in the winter? Nothing! Nothing ‘cept the chores. My brother and I may try to find work elsewhere--but not till I have a vacation. Gee, I wish I could go home for a visit, even for a few days. That’s day-dreaming, though.",Homesickness
,Music? I think I like Bing the bestest. I like smooth lingering music. Of course I classical [sic] -- but not too classical. One thing I don’t like --yet is that corny cave-man music (racket -- I mean). It actually drives me nuts.,Recreation
,(Of course that’s taking for granted that I’m sane--which I’m not out here),
,Of course everyone has their own particular,
3,"likings but I like Bing everytime. He drives me nuts, too--in a different way.",Recreation
,"So you were building castles in the sands? How romantic? Oh, I forgot. There were children with you. How horrible! I pity you, but I bet you did have some fun, huh?",
,"A working woman, are you? School’s your job. Stick to it. I would if I could.",Education
,"Which reminds me, school begins soon again, huh? Tech, tech, how time flies. More books and scraping with the teachers. When I think of school now they seemed lots of fun.",Education
,"You mentioned disagreeable odours of fish. Phooey! I met a skunk the other day and I thought it was very cute. Seems he doesn’t think the same of me, anyhow, i got the worst of him and he got the best of me. I’ll leave it to your imagination as for what happened. Anyway, the dog killed him and I went on my way. Well for the next week the dog and I were both in the dog house. I wouldn’t attempt to describe the odour. Phew!",Recreation
,The moon? I don’t think I’ve ever stopped to admire it. (What-they-hay just about dark),
4,"The sunset is pretty out here, considering the fact that there is nothing but bold-headed prairie hills to give it a beautiful atmosphere. I think the other kids will back me up when I say that the sunset is very beautiful.",Living-conditions
,"I work in my birthday suit so I have a pretty fair tan--but if I keep this up much longer I’ll be burnt to a black crisp. Boy, it sure has been hot on some days, the last two weeks for instance. But today was cold! Can you imagine that? In mid-summer, too! Cold today -- hot tomorrow! Gosh, what goofy weather! How is it out there?",Labour-conditions;Living-conditions
,Did I leave any questions out?,
,"Well what are you doing these days? Working in the peat-plant or are you taking care of the husband with the sick wife? Oh yes, there’s a baby in the family too, isn’t there? (I ain’t a bit funny am I?)",
,How are Donnie and your folks? I hope they’re all well. And you. Are you taking good care of yourself?,
,"Say Joan, do you see many shows? Gosh, I haven’t seen one for so long, I forget what they’re like. Honest. I haven’t gone to Calgary yet, but I expect to some time",Homesickness
5,during the month. My brother took a truck laid of vegetables in last week. He’ll be goin’ in quite often now and I hope to make one of the trips with him. I honestly wouldn’t mind seeing Calgary again. I can still remember some of the old haunts where I used to play and get into a lot of mickey. After all it’s only been about ten years ago.,
,"Gosh! Here I’m talking about nothing -- I guess I’m boring you, huh?",
,"Take care of yourself, Joan. And give my love and best wishes to your folks and of course Donnie.",
,Good-bye till next time -- and don’t worry about us ‘cause we’re all fine.,Optimism
,"Yours,",
,Alby,
,P.S. ------,
,P.P.S.  Imagine that! No P.S.,
,"Bye, Alby",
,(Oops! Over),
6,Joan will you tell me how long my letters take to get to you. This letter will leave Ranier on the 14th one of the two mail days we have.,Mail
,Thanks,
,Alby.,
