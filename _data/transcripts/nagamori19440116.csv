,Dear Joan:,
,"Hellow honey, I’m really sorry for this terrible long delay. The reason why I didn’t answer you letter sooner was because I was way up north of Winnipeg working in a lime quarry, and the fellas at home forgot to send the letter up to me till two month later. After this long delay I felt kind of shy writing back, and it came hard and harder for me to write. But since you encouraged me this Christmas to write I am sincerely glad to do so.",Writing
,By the way I received your Christmas Card on the 28 and I really loved it just as much as I love you. I sent one to you on the 20th I hope you received it because the mail only go out once or twice a wk at this camp.,Communications; Joan
,Well how is the climate like back there in B.C. this winter. I guess its mild there too. Over here it only went as low as 30 below yet and usually it goes 50 below. I heard in part of Saskachewan it rained on the Christmas day. Right now we have foot and couple inches of snow. In Winnipeg I heard they,Living-conditions
2,have only about inch of snow.,Living-conditions
,"Its almost 2 month since we came to work here. I am here to work another two month but I don’t know how I can stand it here. I believe you like to hear a little about over here in Ontario. So far we have only been 100 miles into Ontario so I really haven’t much to tell, but I could say we came across hundreds of small lakes. The trees around here only average 50-60 ft. mostly all evergreen. I haven’t noticed any high mountains yet, but where ever you go is a hill. I like to send some pictures to you of this camp and scenery but it is almost impossible to get films now.",Labour-conditions
,To tell you the truth I think British Columbia is the best place to live and enjoy scenery. ,Homesickness
,I hope i was in the interior of B.C. now where you can come over now and then to see me. Gee but won’t we have lot of fun then Well anyways I’ll hope there’ll be a day when we get together in a near future and have a good time and a good talk with you.,Optimism; Joan; Homesickness
,Well here’s hoping I'll be hearing from you soon. Till then Cheerio! Honey,
,Friend,
