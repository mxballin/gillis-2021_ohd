,"Dearest Joan,",
,"Just a sheet with few lines to say “Hello” and “How are you”. It’s been quite a long time since I’ve heard from you last, and I hope you are all well as we are also.",
,"I imagine you’re going to school every day and enjoying your everyday life. That’s swell!!! Life is very dull out here … no school, no play.",
,"Guess what??? It’s but topping season now. Think of us in the field pulling and topping beets while you’re doing your geometry, social studies, etc. will you Joan? And I’ll think of you having a wonderful time while I work. School begins sometimes in October this year. From Tuesday this week, we’ve been going to top beets every day (about two miles from here.) He comes for us about 7:30 A.M. and takes us home again around 7:00 P.M. This year ",Beet-farms; Homescickness
2,"we do around 1 ½ acres. We might do more when it comes to our beets because we’ll start earlier in the A.M. and quit later in the P.M. and also we’ll work twice as hard as what we’re doing now. This year we have 26 acres and I suppose it will take around 2 weeks and no later, I hope, as we don’t want to pull beets out of the snow. Last year, we finished just in time. The day after we finished, it snowed, but we still had to work in the snow as we did 3 acres of somebody else’s after ours.",
,Oh! but I have so many things to tell you about the beets and every thing out here; I don’t think I could write everything I want to in the letter. ,Communication; Writing
,"Well, I’m just wishing for the day when you and me, telling and hearing each other’s story for hours and hours of what we’ve missed. I only wish it would be soon, don’t you think so, Joan? I’ll write again; a longer letter and I’ll be waiting for yours everyday.",Optimism; Joan; Homesickness
,"Your friend as ever, Sumi E. M.",
Enclosed Postcard,"Dear Joan,",
,"I am enclosing with this letter a postcard showing you a corner of the C. Sugar Factory. The things which are in the box cars are beets. You see at the extreme right of the picture, a pile of beets. This pile grows at least fifty times larger. I am not exaggerating. Love, Sumi. ", Beet-farms
