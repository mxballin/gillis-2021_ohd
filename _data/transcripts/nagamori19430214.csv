,"I hear it went down as long as 45 degrees below in the North Fraser Valley. Is that true? I suppose you have coupla foot of snow there now. My friend in the interior of B.C. says they had 3 ft of snow, but out here we only have 18 in. average.",
, In places there are about 5 ft of snow frozen hard enough to keep us up. One of our boss’s son [sic] recently went trucking up in Alaska and he says its 80 degrees below there. Boy the fuel cost went sky high these days hasn’t it This winter sure,LivingConditions
2,fooled many citizens. I heard in the prairies they’re burning their own houses for fuel. There’s so much snow there the roads are all blocked up. Quite a few highways in Manitoba are blocked up. The peoples around here says this highway’s about the last to get blocked. There are snow plughs working on the highways but it doen’t do much good because the wind out there are too strong it blows the snow around 30-40 feet up in the air.,LivingConditions

The fellas that went to Ontario to cut pulp wood says the trees there are no bigger than a raspberry cane. My brother brought home a piece of birch bark to write letters on It’s almost as smooth and thin as an ordinary writing sheet. He had about foot square of it. He says, Ontario quite similar to B.C. of course there are no",LaborConditions

They all say the French have a big family. They all seem to be friendly towards us at least they have no hatred towards us.
