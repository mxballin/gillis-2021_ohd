,"Dear Joan,",
,Thanks for the pictures you sent. They were really nice pictures.,Photographs
,"Oh, I'm getting along okay. I've out stooking wheat and oats in sunny days. I couldn't tell you if I gained any weight or grew for I haven't weighed myself after I came here. We got hit by small hail although they were about 1/2 in in diameter once after the big hail. They just made holes in the leaves but it can't be noticed now.",Labour-conditions
,We had plenty rain so we didn't have to irrigate the beets.,Beet-farms;Labour-conditions
,Our boss says we may start topping this 24th.,[insert proper term for landowner/supervisor/'boss']
,On Aug 28 Tom came down to our place on bike and I went with him to his place that is about 26 miles on bike. The legs sure was tired when I reached there. It rained that night and day after so I had to stay there a couple of days and had to miss couple of days of schools.,Recreation
,I started school Sept. 2nd and I've only gone about 1 week yet for most of the others I worked. Yesterday I was sick on account I eat too much the day before. The school is quite small compared to Q.E. It has only 2 stories although just the top is the class rooms. And the bottom is the gym shop home ec. and lav. Only 5 rooms on the top. I figured on taking matric last year so I'm taking French right now. I don't know if I can take it all the time or only the smartest people are allowed to take French and Physics. Alberta high school are much different than the B.C. high school. They won't let you take some subject unless you are the smart ones. They don't give credits in 9 and you have to get 105 credits in 3 yrs. In 1 year we have to get 35 credits,Education
2,"The courses are different too. I'm taking Soc St., Eng., Algebra, Shop, French, Physic, health and physical education, and act. I hate art but that was all I could take to get 35 credits. I've only got 5 teachers and a principal. Only one lady teacher and rest all men. The teachers are a joky bunch. They all joke and push the students around in the hallway. You really can have fun with these teachers but they sure give us enough homework to keep us busy. We get enough time at school so it okay. We start school at 9:30 noon hr from 12:30 to 2:00 and from 2:00 to 4:30. The stores are close by so noon hr. and after school we're down the stores. Noon hr. is tiresome for there isn't a thing to do. I'm getting sick of school already for it ain't so hot. Just learn the same things.",Education
,I can't think up any more so I guess I should [quiting???] here but write soon and tell how school days are.,
,Well so-long,
,"Sincerely,",
