,Dearest Joan;,
,"“Happy Easter” to you, Joan. “Best Wishes” to you from all of us. How are you and everybody? Well, I hope, as we all are also. I am very very sorry for not writing to you sooner …. for some … ah … unfavorable circumstance! I hope I didn’t keep you waiting very long. Ahem!!!",Writing
,"Well, Joan, how is school? Fine? Well, I hope so, as I’m getting used to this “hostility.” You know, about two weeks ago snakes started to appear & some boys thought that they were smart and put a live snake into a girl’s zipper loose-leaf. She didn’t know anything about it, and when she unzipped it during the period (study period.) the snake just sprung at her & was she frightened! Poor girl, & she just can’t stand snakes. This isn’t the only incident that has happened. I saw a snake coiled on the banister and several times live snakes wandering in the rooms. Especially the Grade X room because its [sic] only the Grade X boys who would think of doing it. Well, I’m glad as the principle gave a lecture on such a behavior. Baseball game has opened up once again. We play baseball every gym period. Outdoors if the day is fine or indoors when it isn’t.",Education; Recreation
2,"In the first French test I had 85%. Then the next test I had 88% and then the one I took the other, I had 94%! Would you believe it? (I was the highest, and the rest came in with 10%, 20%, 32%. Gee! what a bunch! Even our French teacher said that we’re the worst French I class that she ever taught.) Well, this is our Raymond High School as they call it. Just now, we’re having a four day Easter holiday. 23rd, 24th, 25th & 26th. This is only for the High School; the public school got off from 23rd to May 3rd, lucky things. The school van is still running, thank goodness. We were going to get a 2 ½ hour Easter exam (for each subject I mean) before the holiday but the teachers decided not to give it this year as we’re fairly behind in our school work. We’re all looking forward to the June Exam!!",Education
,"On April 21st we saw an Air Force Picture, brought by the Air Force Company from Ont. They are showing the picture all over the Prairie Provinces encouraging the girls to join the Women’s Air Force. It shows mainly what the girls do when they join up. It lasted for about two hours and it wasn’t bad at all. You haven’t by some chance seen it, have you?",WWII; Recreation
,"On April 3rd, all of our family went to see some a plays, dances, singing, etc. which lasted from 3:00 P.M. to 11:30 P.M. We had to take our lunches and had ½ hour off from 6:00-6:30 P.M. to eat it.",Recreation
3,"The hall was just packed full; there were trucks from Picture Butte, Cardston, Coaldale, Stirling, etc. We had ride [sic] all the way home. Next morning I didn’t wake up till 11:00 A.M. Then on April 11th, we all went to a two feature Japanese show which lasted from 7:30 P.M. – 12:00 P.M. We had a ride home again all the way free. On April 14th, I went to the “Iceland” matinee after school with Teruko Ikeda. We got in for 15 ȼ. Did you see this picture? I thought it wasn’t as good as “Sun Valley Serenade” although “Iceland” had more skating in it.",Recreation
,"On April 17, the whole family went to Lethbridge C.P.R. station to meet our uncle & his family from Kaslo en route to Ontario. We last saw them on April 20th, 1942 when we left N.W. & we didn’t see them till almost a year. I was disgusted with them because they wouldn’t stay in Raymond. We had only 15 minutes to chat and bid farewell. Good thing it was on Sunday.",Forced-dispersal

,"Tomorrow, April 25th (Easter Sunday) the United Church decided to take a trip to some kind of a lake, about 36 miles from Raymond to pass the Easter Sunday. Well, they discovered that they couldn’t take us all as there won’t be enough room so only 2 from each family could go. Sad thing, we were waiting for this day. Only father and mother are",Recreation
4,"going from our family. There’s only one chance out of ten when you find us all at home now a days [sic]. We’re nearing to our beet work again this year so we decided to go out when the weather is fine and before we get busy again. There are several places where beet seeds have been planted already. We haven’t got our seeds planted yet, but are expecting it in a short while. The field has been ploughed & ready to be planted.",Labour-conditions
,"This year it seems as though its [sic] going to be very hot. For the past few weeks, I’ve worn no overcoat but a ¾ jacket every day. We can’t compare it with the weather when we first came here. This year I think we’re going to have 25-27 acres of beets. Last year we had only 21 acres although we came for 25. Dad doesn’t want to do so much. We tell him that we could do at least 30 acres, but he won’t say “okay.” He keeps on saying that 25 acres is enough. Oh, well, its [sic] up to him,",Living-conditions; Labour-conditions
,"& so much the better I am sending you some pictures with this letter. Don’t you think its about time to do so? The’re [sic] not very good pictures, but when we do take some better ones, I will send you some even if its a year after.",Photographs

,"P.S.1. I just finished looking over your February 21st letter and you wanted to know how we were making out on ration cards. Well, as for sugar, we’re going swell. For butter, we get so far behind that many tickets have been thrown away. We use around two lbs. a week. We don’t buy any coffee at all. As for tea, we just can’t buy all the tickets worth. Only ones who drinks [sic] it are my mom, dad, Kay & myself very seldom. The rest drinks milk or cocoa.",WWII
,"P.S.2. Mother would be very glad if you could send some plants. She’s planning to have a flower garden this year & have already planted some poppy seeds. She doesn’t mind what kind of plants you send unless it won’t be such a bother to you. I’m sure she’d appreciate anything you can send. When we do go back to S.W. she said she’d take all the presents back, so if you want anything special, just say so in the letters. This is about the only way in which I can ever repay you.

,"P.S. 4. I forgot all about the “Sadie Hawkin’s Day.” We had it last month for a month week. Some boys were dressed up as ladies and what beautiful ladies they seemed! (especially the legs.) Three of the tallest boys were on stilts which made them appear as a giant. The got a good kick of it. Almost every girls wore pigtails. This was the first time I’ve ever worn pigtails to school. Some sights!!!!! Enough said, I think!!!!! S.M.",Recreation; Education
