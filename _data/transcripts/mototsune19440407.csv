2,"holiday? How long do you get yours? Now’s my chance to get my book reviews written. Imagine, five book-reviews and then “school-books.” (they’re library books, but a list of books are suggested for school-reading; and we have to read 10 off [sic] this list.) I’ve read all my ten books but I haven’t written any book-reviews, yet.",Education
,"In French “Author’s” text, we read ten stories out of fifteen. In French “Grammar” text, we’ll be finished with this course by the end of this month, & we’re going to review over [sic]. There is only 12 students in Fr. II class – 9 girls & 3 boys!",Education

,"We finished our Sociology text, so we’re reviewing over again. After we have finished that, we’re going to work in groups on a project. We haven’t decided on the topic, yet. I went to the Kinsmen’s – “Milk for Britain Fund, Victory Revue.” It was held in the opera house, and was there a crowd!! The programme [sic] was good – from 8:30 to 10:30. P.M.",Education

And is she ever spoiled, being the only child. She’ll be two years old in June. I’m teaching her to point where-ever I say; such as nose, mouth, eye, etc. She might be a spoiled child, but she’s not so dumb. On the whole, she’s quite clever.",Labour-conditions
,"Our school-paper, which was destributed [sic] on Monday, created quite a disturbance. The cover, which had every teacher’s cartoon and nick-names on it, had “APRIL FOOLS” written on it because it was an April issue. That afternoon all the teacher’s bowled Hazel Taylor (the artist) out, not for the cartoons, but for the word “FOOLS.” They didn’t like the letter “S.” on “fools.” The",Education

[sic]) On the bulletin board, somebody pinned up a large paper with the words painted in red paint “DICTATORS – FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.” On Tuesday night, around 10:00 - 10:30 P.M., the kids had a – a real one, with torches and banners declaring the freedom of the “Hi – Times” room. They even stopped the traffic and blockaded the roads. It surely was some “mob mind.” The radio broadcasted about this over the air and it was also written in the papers. Some school, and some kids!!!!! Majority [sic] of the students came back on Wed. but there was [sic] some who still stayed out. The whole town was talking about the “high-school.” The kids were",Education
5,"so mad at the teachers that they pinned the “Hi-Times” cover all over the town and broke into the school office and pinned the covers all over the walls and the desk [sic]. So you can just imagine what the whole town was talking about for four days. I’ll enclose the Hi-Times cover with this letter. The cartoons are very good, especially Mr. Gloat, who certainly is a gloat. And how!!!!!",Education
